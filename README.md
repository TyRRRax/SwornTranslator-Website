# SwornTranslator-Website
My project of Maciej Ka≈Ñski, Sworn Translator

It was screen from beta project, I've been waiting for new banner(video), that's why there've been crops. 
It's also a problem with screen making program, which cause moving apart a website on screen. That's just a bug of the screen making program. In my project everything worked properly.
